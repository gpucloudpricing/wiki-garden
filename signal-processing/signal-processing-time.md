# Signal Processing in the Time Domain

- Correlation Analysis
  - Autocorrelation: similarity a variable with its past, for finding repeating patterns
  - Cross-correlation: similarity of two variables as a function of time-lag applied
- Covariance Analysis
  - Autocovariance: variability a variable with its past
  - Cross-covariance:  
- Statistical Features in the Time Domain
    - Mean: mathematical average
    - Variance: population variance represents a measure of dispersion
    - Standard deviation; a measure of variability
    - Mean absolute deviation
    - Root amplitude
    - Root mean square (RMS): a measure of signal magnitude
    - Square mean root (SMR): a measure of signal magnitude
    - Peak: maximum value
    - Peak to Peak
    - Skewness: normalized third central moment represents a measure of symmetry
    - Kurtosis: normalized fourth central moment represents a measure of distribution spread
    - Crest factor: ratio of the peak level to the RMS level
    - Latitude factor: ratio of the peak level to the SMR level
    - Clearance factor
    - Shape factor (form factor): ratio of RMS to mean of absolute
    - Impulse factor: indication of shock in a waveform
    - THIKAT
    - TALAF
    - Slope Sign Change
    - Willison Amplitude
    - Zero crossing
- Others
  - Derivative
  - Integral
  - Convolution
