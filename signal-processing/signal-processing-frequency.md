## Signal Processing in the Frequency Domain

- Fourier Transform
  - Fourier Series
  - Fourier Transform
  - Discrete Fourier Transform
  - Fast Fourier Transform
- Envelope Spectrum Magnitude
- Statistical features in the frequency domain
  - Mean frequency
  - Median frequency
  - Maximum to minimum drop in Power Density Ratio
  - Signal to Noise Ratio
  - Signal to Motion Artifact Ratio
  - Frequency-power density mean
  - Frequency standard deviation
  - Mean frequency
  - Frequency skewness
  - p1, mean frequency
  - p2 - p4

### Advantages

- Powerful analysis and accepted standard for fault detection on steady state
- A great deal of studies supports its application
- Low computational cost

### Weakness

- Limited to static signals (stationary condition)
