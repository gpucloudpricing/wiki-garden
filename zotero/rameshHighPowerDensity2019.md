#### Abstract

The growth of electric and hybrid electric vehicles has drawn more attention toward the development of high power density electrical machines. The materials used in the fabrication of electrical machines play a crucial role in enhancing their power density. In this paper, the significance of advanced magnetic materials for lamination, nano-material based conducting materials, and high energy product permanent magnets (PMs) is discussed in detail. Finally, a case study has been presented with a 5 kW PM synchronous machine in order to understand the advantages of the discussed materials.
