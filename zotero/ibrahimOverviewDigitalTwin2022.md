#### Abstract

The signiﬁcant progress in the electric automotive industry brought a higher need for new technological innovations. Digital Twin (DT) is one of the hottest trends of the fourth industrial revolution. It allows representing physical assets under various operating conditions in a low-cost and zero-risk environment. DTs are used in many different ﬁelds from aerospace to healthcare. However, one of the perspective applications of such technology is the automotive industry. This paper presents an overview of the implementation of DT technology in electric vehicles (EV) propulsion drive systems. A general review of DT technology is supplemented with main applications analysis and comparison between different simulation technologies. Primary attention is given to the adaptation of DT technology for EV propulsion drive systems.

> “The difference between digital twin and simulation is largely a matter of scale: While a simulation typically studies one particular process, a digital twin can itself run any number of useful simulations to study multiple processes.” Yellow Highlight [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQECJMTL?page=4)

DT vs DM is a matter of scale.

> “However, digital twins are designed around a two-way flow of information that first occurs when object sensors provide relevant data to the system processor and then happens again when insights created by the processor are shared back with the source object.” Yellow Highlight [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQECJMTL?page=4)
