#### Abstract

This paper presents a review on the recent research and technical progress of electric motor systems and electric powertrains for new energy vehicles. Through the analysis and comparison of direct current motor, induction motor, and synchronous motor, it is found that permanent magnet synchronous motor has better overall performance; by comparison with converters with Si-based IGBTs, it is found converters with SiC MOSFETs show significantly higher efficiency and increase driving mileage per charge. In addition, the pros and cons of different control strategies and algorithms are demonstrated. Next, by comparing series, parallel, and power split hybrid powertrains, the series–parallel compound hybrid powertrains are found to provide better fuel economy. Different electric powertrains, hybrid powertrains, and range-extended electric systems are also detailed, and their advantages and disadvantages are described. Finally, the technology roadmap over the next 15 years is proposed regarding traction motor, power electronic converter and electric powertrain as well as the key materials and components at each time frame.
