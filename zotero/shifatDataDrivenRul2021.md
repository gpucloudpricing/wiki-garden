#### Abstract

An effective remaining useful life (RUL) estimation method is of great concern in industrial machinery to ensure system reliability and reduce the risk of unexpected failures. Anticipation of an electric motor’s future state can improve the yield of a system and warrant the reuse of the industrial asset. In this paper, we present an effective RUL estimation framework of brushless DC (BLDC) motor using third harmonic analysis and output apparent power monitoring. In this work, the mechanical output of the BLDC motor is monitored through a coupled generator. To emphasize the total power generation, we have analyzed the trend of apparent power, which preserves the characteristics of real power and reactive power in an AC power system. A normalized modal current (NMC) is used to extract the current features from the BLDC motor. Fault characteristics of motor current and generator power are fused using a Kalman filter to estimate the RUL. Degradation patterns for the BLDC motor have been monitored for three different scenarios and for future predictions, an attention layer optimized bidirectional long short-term memory (ABLSTM) neural network model is trained. ABLSTM model’s performance is evaluated based on several metrics and compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models.
