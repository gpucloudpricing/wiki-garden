#### Abstract

Electric motors are one of the key building blocks of electric vehicles (EVs). The electric motor is drawing particular attention due to the variety of topologies that can be chosen as candidates for EV applications. Through the proper motor type selection and design, the performance of EVs can be enhanced, such as efficiency and stability. This paper presents a state-of-the-art overview of alternative electric motors for EV applications. Firstly, the classification and performance of alternative electric motors is described. Then, research gaps and possible future trends are introduced and identified in this review paper.
