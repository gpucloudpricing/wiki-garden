#### Abstract

Digital twin network (DTN) is an emerging network that utilizes digital twin (DT) technology to create the virtual twins of physical objects. DTN realizes co-evolution between physical and virtual spaces through DT modeling, communication, computing, data processing technologies. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of DTN to explore the potentiality of DT. First, we elaborate key features and definitions of DTN. Next, the key technologies and the technical challenges in DTN are discussed. Furthermore, we depict the typical application scenarios, such as manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, 6G networks, intelligent transportation systems, and urban intelligence in smart cities. Finally, the new trends and open research issues related to DTN are pointed out.


#### Notes
  
**This paper trying to define DT Networks.**

The paper attempts to define DTN, its key technology, technical challenges, typical applications, new trends and open research issues.

> “DT encompasses three parts, a physical object, its virtual twin and a mapping between the physical object and its virtual twin that enables co-evolution of both physical and virtual sides.” Yellow Highlight [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HGPVEED7?page=3)

DT is defined as mapping between physical and its virtual object.

> “DTN as a many-to-many mapping network constructed by multiple one-to-one DTs.” Yellow Highlight [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HGPVEED7?page=3)

DTN is defined as interaction between multiple physical and multiple virtual objects.
