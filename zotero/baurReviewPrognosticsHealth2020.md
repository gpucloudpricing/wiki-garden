#### Abstract

This paper presents a survey of the applications of prognostics and health management maintenance strategy to machine tools. A complete perspective on this Industry 4.0 cutting-edge maintenance policy, through the analysis of all its preliminary phases, is given as an introduction. Then, attention is given to prognostics, whose different approaches are briefly classified and explained, pointing out their advantages and shortcomings. After that, all the works on prognostics of machine tools and their main subsystem are reviewed, highlighting current open research areas for improvement.
