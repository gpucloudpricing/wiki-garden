#### Abstract


#### Notes
  
Digital twin vs digital shadow (1) The DT can provide a high-fidelity digital mirror model (2) Based on the model, the physical processes and activities can be validated before execution (3) The model operates in synchronization with the entity (note: bidirectional) (4) The data in the DT are not only from the physical world, but also from the virtual models, and some data are derived from fusion of data from the two worlds (note: enhancement)

Digital twin vs digital shadow
(1) The DT can provide a high-fidelity digital mirror model

(2) Based on the model, the physical processes and activities can be validated before execution
(3) The model operates in synchronization with the entity (note: bidirectional)

(4) The data in the DT are not only from the physical world, but also from the virtual models, and some data are derived from fusion of data from the two worlds (note: enhancement)
