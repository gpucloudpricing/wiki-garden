#### Abstract

There is a constant call for reduction of operational and maintenance costs of induction motors (IMs). These costs can be significantly reduced if the health of the system is monitored regularly. This allows for early detection of the degeneration of the motor health, alleviating a proactive response, minimizing unscheduled downtime, and unexpected breakdowns. The condition based monitoring has become an important task for engineers and researchers mainly in industrial applications such as railways, oil extracting mills, industrial drives, agriculture, mining industry etc. Owing to the demand and influence of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in IMs and keeping in mind the prerequisite for future research, this paper presents the state of the art review describing different type of IM faults and their diagnostic schemes. Several monitoring techniques available for fault diagnosis of IM have been identified and represented. The utilization of non-invasive techniques for data acquisition in automatic timely scheduling of the maintenance and predicting failure aspects of dynamic machines holds a great scope in future.
