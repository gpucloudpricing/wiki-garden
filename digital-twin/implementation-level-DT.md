Implementation Level of DT  
In manufacturing, you can use a digital twin technology at various levels:

- Component level–focused on a single, highly critical component within the manufacturing process.
- Asset level–creating a digital twin of a single piece of equipment within a production line.
- System level–using a digital twin to monitor and improve an entire production line.
- Process level–this looks at the entire manufacturing process from product and process design and development, to manufacturing and production. It also applies to distribution and the use of the finished product by customers/patients throughout the entire life cycle, as well as for the development of future products.
