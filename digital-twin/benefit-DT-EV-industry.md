# Benefit of Digital Twin in Electric Vehicle Industries

In a general sense, the digital twin can emulate the actual vehicle on the road in order to predict/optimize its performance and improve the car safety. Additionally, the digital twin can be used for optimization of the manufacturing processes, real-time condition monitoring (at all levels and in all drivetrain components), energy management optimization, repurposing of the components, and even recycling processes.

What is a digital twin and what benefits does it bring?

- test prototypes for their functionality, durability and user expectations;
- predict defects and analyze possible design errors;
- save time and financial means;
- reduce design and production risks;
- improve monitoring capabilities of vehicle fleets;
- and best of all–it enables continuous product improvement, as it often collects data from not only one, but thousands of objects. This makes it learn faster and predict defects more precisely, as it is based on knowledge gathered from a vast  number of sources.
