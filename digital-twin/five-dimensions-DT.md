# Five Dimensions of Digital Twin

The dimensions according to [Falekas. 2021. *Digital twin in electrical machine control and predictive maintenance: state-of-the-art and future prospects*](zotero://select/items/1_S8ZD9NAZ) are :

1. Physical;
2. Virtual;
3. Service;
4. Data;
5. Connections.

The five dimensions according to [thelenComprehensiveReviewDigital2022](../zotero/thelenComprehensiveReviewDigital2022.md) are:

1. Physical System (PS). The physical system (PS) with sensing capability gathers data from multiple sources using various sensing and data acquisition techniques.
2. Digital System (DS). The updating engine (P2V) updates the state of the digital model based on the sensor data.
3. Updating Engine (P2V). The updated digital models (DS) are then employed to predict the future state of the physical system using the prediction engine (V2P), thereby enabling predictive decision making feeding back to the physical system through actuators (control, maintenance, path planning, etc.).
4. Prediction Engine (V2P)
5. Optimization Dimension (OPT). An optimization dimension (OPT, i.e., the fifth dimension) supports the functionalities of the other four dimensions in the digital twin by optimizing the data collection, modeling, state estimation, decision making, etc.
