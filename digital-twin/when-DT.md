## When Digital Twin is Used?

Digital twins are of most use when an object is changing over time, thus making the initial model of the object invalid, and when measurement data that can be correlated with this change can be captured ([wrightHowTellDifference2020](../zotero/wrightHowTellDifference2020.md))

Example in autonomous vehicle:  
Staging real-world tests for all of these events would be costly, complicated to implement reliably, and potentially dangerous. It is therefore far more cost efficient and safe to simulate these tests. A digital twin for this application would link:

- an accurate and updatable model of a real-world driving environment, including other vehicles and pedestrians and some description of weather and other atmospheric and environmental effects,
- models that simulate the response of the sensors deployed on the vehicle based on a careful choice of data from tests of these sensors,
- a model of the vehicle response to driving commands (e.g. steering changes, braking, etc.) that takes road surface conditions into account,
- and the AV control algorithms.
