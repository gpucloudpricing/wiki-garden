# System Modeling in Digital Twin

## According to [thelenComprehensiveReviewDigital2022](../zotero/thelenComprehensiveReviewDigital2022.md)

### System Modeling

  - Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Models: Structure diagram (system hierarchies), behavior diagram (state machine)
  - Ontology

## According to [qiEnablingTechnologiesTools2021](qiEnablingTechnologiesTools2021.md):

- Behavioral model describes various behaviors of a physical entity to fulfill functions, respond to changes, interact with others, adjust internal operations, maintain health, etc. These models can be developed based on finite state machines, Markov chains, and ontology-based modeling methods, etc.
- State modeling includes state diagram and activity diagram. Dynamics modeling deals with rigid body motion, elastic system motion, high-speed rotating body motion, and fluid motion.
- Rule model describes the rules extracted from historical data, expert knowledge, and predefined logic. The rules equip the virtual model with an ability to reason, judge, evaluate, optimize, and predict. Rule modeling involves rule extraction, rule description, rule association, and rule evolution. Rule extraction involves both symbolic methods (e.g., decision tree and rough set theory) and connectionist methods (e.g., neural network).
