## data-fusion-DT

Data fusion copes with multisource data through synthesis, filtering, correlation, and integration.

Data fusion categories:

- raw-data-level fusion,
- feature-level fusion, and
- decision-level fusion.

Data fusion methods:

- random methods. Random methods (e.g., classical reasoning, weighted average method, Kalman filtering, Bayesian estimation, and Dempster-Shafer evidence reasoning,) are applicable for all three levels of data fusion.  
- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence methods (e.g., fuzzy set theory, rough set theory, neural network, wavelet theory, and support vector machine) are applicable for the feature-level and decision-level data fusions.
