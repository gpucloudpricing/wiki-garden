## Model Order Reduction (MOR)

An alternative approach to improving computational efficiency for models based on partial differential equations is the application of model order reduction (MOR) methods [23]. The approach seeks to characterize the system being modelled in terms of a small number of functions or “modes”. The approach is analogous to the Fourier series decomposition of a time-dependent signal as a sum of sine and cosine terms.
