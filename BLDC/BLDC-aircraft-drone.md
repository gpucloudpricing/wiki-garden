## BLDC for Aircraft and Drone

### Heavy Lift Drone Motors

Design life: 1000 hrs

Heavy-lift drone motors are used for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) that need to carry heavier payloads such as LiDAR scanners or bulky sensors, or to transport significant amounts of cargo. They provide the high levels of thrust required for these greater take-off weights.

High power drone motorsMotors used for large drones tend to be electric brushless DC motors, as these are more efficient than brushed motors. Brushless motors use non-contact methods to transfer current from the commutator to the rotor, meaning that less energy is lost through friction.

### Applications

### Military Drones

Military applications for heavy lift [tactical drones](https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/expo/tactical-drones/) include ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), weaponized payloads, and equipment delivery to areas too dangerous for manned flight.

#### Commercial Drones

Commercial uses for heavy lift multirotors include inspection and surveying as well as professional mapping applications and aerial cinematography.

#### Industrial Drones

Often used in construction and pipeline inspection, industrial heavy lift drones can carry sensors to detect gas and fuel leaks, thermal and infrared cameras used for inspection and mapping, weather sensors, survey equipment and LiDAR sensors.

#### Agricultural Drones

Heavy payload drones are used extensively as [agricultural drones](https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/category/supplier-directory/platforms/agricultural-drones/), saving time and money by undertaking crop spraying and monitoring, as well as assisting in harvest planning and using hyperspectral cameras to detect damage to crops, soil deficiencies and other factors impacting growth.

#### Cargo and Delivery Drones

Drones capable of carrying heavy loads are becoming increasingly popular as [cargo drones](https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/expo/cargo-drones/), used to deliver medical and healthcare supplies such as medicines, blood and vaccines as well as emergency equipment and supplies during search and rescue and disaster relief operations. Heavy lift delivery drones can also be used to transport goods and mail to and from remote communities, being both faster and less expensive than transitional modes of transportation.

### Regular Drone Motors

Design life: 10000 hrs  
Brushless drone motors have a long life expectancy. **They can easily last for ten years or more because the motors do not have any brushes to cause friction.**

However, as much as they hardly wear, other elements affect brushless motors. They include dirt, overheating, water, and bad bearings.

Your drone’s performance is highly dependent on the motors. If the motors are in good shape, you can be sure to get the best out of your drone. This is why you should take good care of the motors.

The best way to do this is by always keeping the motors clean. Clean the motors with canned air, or a soft-bristled brush. If needed, use a slightly damp cloth to remove grime. Once you clean them, ensure they are dried since water is not good for motors. 

You should also ensure that your drone motors don’t overheat. Give the drone time to cool down between flights, even if you have spare batteries. Just a 10-minute break is enough to give the motors time to cool down to avoid overheating.
