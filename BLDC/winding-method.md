## BLDC Winding

- Concentrated  
  - With a concentrated winding, the stator is always wound exactly over one tooth.
  - simpler, cheaper
  - less end winding
  - losses because of more harmonic contents in the magnetic flux

- Distributed  
  - With a distributed winding, at least two teeth of the stator are always wound.
