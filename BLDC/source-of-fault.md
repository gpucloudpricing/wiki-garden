## Source of Electric Motor Fault

- Age. It’s easy to blame motor failure on age, but the reality is that the unstoppable creep of time is responsible for fewer than 20% of motor failures. In fact, **[Cooper Bussmann](https://www.progress-energy.com/assets/www/docs/business/motor-protection-voltage-unbalance.pdf)** says old age causes only 10% of electric motor failures.
- Bearing 51%. Bearings are the culprit in more than half of motor failure cases. Improper lubrication, inappropriate mechanical loads, heat, contamination and shaft currents are all the usual suspects when it comes to bearing problems.
- Winding 16%. A winding failure—which is often caused by a breakdown of the winding’s insulation—will cause a short in the motor. Common causes of winding failure include high temperature, too many starts, contamination, too much current, excessive voltage and physical damage. We've put together a post on [**winding failure**](https://www.dukeelectric.com/blog/3-phase-winding-failure-examples/), with awesome photos courtesy of EASA, if you're looking for examples.
- External causes 16%. Tied with windings for almost 1 in 5 motor failures, external factors include temperature, contamination, poor maintenance, inappropriate mechanical loads and events such as flooding.
- Unknown. 1 in 10 failures are mysterious. Either no one bothered to determine why the failure occurred, so Bonnett and Yung didn’t have any data to work with, or the investigation failed to determine a cause.
- Rotor 5%. Starts (too many, not enough of a break between them or extended start times), sudden action or outburst,  are the culprit in some rotor failures. Other failures are caused by vibration, physical damage and situations that causes excessive heat.
- Shaft or coupling 2%. Shaft failure is the least common cause of motor failure. Physical damage, corrosion, improper installation and excessive loads are often the root cause.
