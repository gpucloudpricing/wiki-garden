## SoTa for non-periodic Time Series

For non-periodical time-series data, such as vibration data, the choice of classification method depends on various factors including the complexity of the data, the amount of available labeled data, computational resources, and the specific goals of your analysis. Here are some state-of-the-art and effective methods for time-series classification of non-periodical data:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs, originally designed for image processing, have been adapted for time-series analysis by treating the time domain as the equivalent of the image's spatial dimension. They automatically learn features from the data, making them powerful for capturing complex patterns in vibration data. 1D-CNNs and variants like Residual Networks (ResNet) have shown great success in this context.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-range dependencies in time-series data. They are suitable for capturing temporal dynamics in vibration data, even when patterns have varying lengths.

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): Similar to LSTMs, GRUs are another type of RNN that can handle sequential data. They have fewer parameters than LSTMs and can be effective for time-series classification tasks.

Transformer-based Models: Transformer architectures, initially designed for natural language processing, have shown promise in various sequential data tasks, including time-series classification. Models like Timeformer adapt the transformer architecture for time-series analysis.

1D-CNN with Attention Mechanisms: Combining 1D-CNNs with attention mechanisms can help the model focus on important segments of the data and improve its ability to extract relevant features.

Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models can enhance the robustness and accuracy of time-series classification. Techniques like stacking, bagging, and boosting can be applied to combine the predictions of different models.

Spectral Analysis Techniques: If your vibration data has frequency-related features, techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) can help you extract frequency-domain information for classification.

Hybrid Models: Combine different types of models to leverage their respective strengths. For example, you might combine a CNN for local feature extraction with an LSTM for capturing temporal relationships.

Self-Supervised Learning: Utilize self-supervised learning approaches to pre-train a model on unlabeled data, then fine-tune it for classification using the labeled data. This can help in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Autoencoders: Unsupervised pre-training using autoencoders can help in capturing important features from the data, which can then be used for classification.

Keep in mind that the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific characteristics of your vibration data and the problem you are trying to solve. It's advisable to experiment with multiple methods, fine-tune hyperparameters, and perform thorough evaluation to determine which approach performs best for your specific use case.

## SoTA for Anomaly in Periodic Time Series

For time-series classification of periodical data with anomalies in phase or magnitude, such as current data, it's important to consider methods that can capture both the periodic patterns and the deviations from these patterns. Here are some state-of-the-art and effective methods for tackling such scenarios:

Autoencoders with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Autoencoders can learn to represent normal periodic patterns and anomalies in the data. Variational Autoencoders extend this by learning a probabilistic distribution of the latent space, which can help model the uncertainty in detecting anomalies.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Attention Mechanisms: LSTMs can capture long-range dependencies and temporal patterns. Coupling them with attention mechanisms allows the model to focus on specific parts of the time series, which is useful for detecting anomalies.

Wavelet Transform: Wavelet Transform can provide insights into both the frequency and time localization of anomalies. You can focus on the wavelet coefficients' magnitude and phase to detect deviations from normal patterns.

Fourier Transform and Spectrogram Analysis: Analyzing the frequency domain with Fourier Transform or creating spectrograms can help identify anomalies that cause deviations in phase or magnitude.

Periodic Model Decomposition: If you know the approximate periodicity, you can decompose the time series into its periodic and residual components. This allows you to focus on anomalies in the residual component.

Hybrid Models: Combine different models that capture different aspects of the data. For example, you might use a CNN to capture local features and an LSTM to capture temporal dependencies, then combine their outputs for classification.

GANs for Anomaly Generation: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to generate synthetic anomaly data based on the learned distribution of normal data. These synthetic anomalies can then be used for training anomaly detectors.

Spectral Anomaly Detection: If anomalies manifest as deviations in specific frequency components, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Fourier spectrum or phase information can be helpful.

Ensemble Techniques: Combining predictions from multiple models, each focusing on different aspects of the data, can improve anomaly detection robustness.

Self-Supervised Learning: If labeled anomaly data is scarce, self-supervised learning can help the model learn useful representations from the normal data, which can then be used for anomaly detection.

When dealing with anomalies in phase or magnitude, consider whether the anomalies are known beforehand or if you're dealing with unsupervised anomaly detection. Each method should be adapted to the specific characteristics of your data, and thorough experimentation and evaluation are essential to determine the best approach for your use case.
