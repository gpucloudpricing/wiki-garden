## Streamlit
- Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects. With Streamlit, you can quickly build and deploy web apps using simple Python scripts, without needing to have any web development experience. Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for creating interactive visualizations, displaying data, and allowing users to interact with your models or analysis. It also supports real-time updates, so you can easily iterate and make changes to your app as you develop it. Overall, Streamlit is a powerful tool for creating and sharing data-driven web applications.

## InfluxDB + Streamlit
- InfluxDB is a high-performance, open-source time series database. It is designed to handle large amounts of time-stamped data and enables fast storage and retrieval of time series data for real-time analytics and monitoring purposes. InfluxDB uses a flexible data model that allows storing, querying, and aggregating data based on time intervals, making it well-suited for applications that require tracking and analyzing time series data, such as IoT sensor data, monitoring systems, and financial data.
- Telegraf  is a server-based agent for collecting and sending all metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf is written in Go and compiles into a single binary with no external dependencies, and requires a very minimal memory footprint.

## Hono - Ditto
**Eclipse Hono** provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol. Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols, as standard, such as HTTP, MQTT and AMQP.
**Eclipse Ditto** is a framework that supports IoT Digital twins software pattern implementation. Ditto’s capabilities includes: mirrors physical assets/devices, acts as a “single source of truth” for a physical asset, provides aspects and services around devices, and keeps real and digital worlds in sync.
**Apache Kafka** enables the building of data pipelines for real-time streaming applications. Kafka is seamlessly horizontally scalabe, false tolerant and high speed. The three main capabilities of Kafka is to, 1. publish and subscribe to stream of records, 2. store these records in fault tolerant way, and 3. process them as they occur.
**Influx DB** is a real-time series database, which is simple to setup and scale.
**Grafana** is an analytics and monitoring solution which provides plugin data source models and support for many of the most popular time series database

There are many technologies that can be used to realize bidirectional communication. For example, Ditto and RabbitMQ as mentioned above.

Many different technologies already exist for tackling the communication issues, i.e. RabbitMQ ([https://www.rabbitmq.com/](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)), Ditto([https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/)), Apache Kafka([https://kafka.apache.org/](https://kafka.apache.org/)), and [https://www.rti.com/](https://www.rti.com/). In our case, we chose RabbitMQ to serve as a data broker because of its lightweight and easy deployment on premise.

Regarding data storage, we used InfluxDB for its ease of use, its bindings to different programming languages, and its simple visualization facilities.

Recent advances in tools for creating visual interfaces such as Unity([https://unity.com/](https://unity.com/)), Qt([https://www.qt.io/](https://www.qt.io/)). Grafana, Dash, Gazebo, and so on, have made it easier to create intuitive and visual interfaces for a DS. One of the challenges in DT engineering is the rapid construction of these interfaces from a PT. Such interfaces should, for example, allow the user to: 1) Selectively visualize the 3D PT and its state; 2) Create dashboards to plot the most important data; 3) Replay past behavior of the PT; 4) Spawn new what-if simulations; 5) Run optimizations; 6) Display predictive maintenance results;
