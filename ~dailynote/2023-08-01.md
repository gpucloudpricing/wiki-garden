Definition
â€¢ Traditional ML: all training data available at same time
â€¢ Continual learning: 
  - training data arrives incrementally
  - there is non-stationarity

![Reconstruction Strategy](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522000771-gr6.jpg)

The specific reconstruction steps of the digital twin model are as follows. When the working condition changes, the current working condition changes from the original working condition to the target working condition. A small amount of machining data under the target working condition is collected and preprocessed to obtain the machining data set of the target working condition. Based on the machining data set of the target working condition, the experimental parameters of the mechanism model are finetuned to complete the self-renewal. Then, the primary features of the original data are extracted to obtain the feature data of the target working condition and get stored into the feature database. After this, the distribution distance of feature data between the current working condition and other working condition is calculated to obtain the feature data set with the smallest distribution distance. The data set is indexed in the algorithm model base and machining database to obtain the original model in the algorithm library and the machining data set of related working conditions.
