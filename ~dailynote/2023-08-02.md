## Machine Learning Repeating Procedure

[Simpler Experimentation with Jupyter, Papermill, and MLflow](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/experimentation-workflow-with-jupyter-papermill-mlflow/)

All metrics, visualizations, and model binaries in a single UI.

There are three main components:

- `jupyter`: Quick, iterative development and visualization of code and output
- `papermill`: Running one notebook with different parameters; output into separate notebooks
- `mlflow`: Logging of metrics and artifacts within a single UI
