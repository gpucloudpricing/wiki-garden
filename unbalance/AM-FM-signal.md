## AM-FM Signal 

A multicomponent AM-FM signal refers to a signal that exhibits both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) characteristics, and contains multiple frequency components. In such a signal, the amplitude and frequency of each component can vary independently over time, resulting in a complex and time-varying signal structure.

In a multicomponent AM-FM signal, multiple carrier frequencies are modulated by different modulating signals simultaneously. Each carrier frequency may have its own unique modulation characteristics, such as different modulation depths or modulation frequencies. This results in a composite signal with varying amplitudes and frequencies across different frequency components.

In general, the equation of a multicomponent AM-FM signal can be represented as:

$$
[x(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i(t) \cos\left[\omega_c(t) t + \phi_i(t)\right]]
$$


where:

-   (x(t)) is the composite signal at time (t).
-   (N) represents the number of frequency components in the signal.
-   $(A_i(t))$ is the time-varying amplitude of the ith component.
-   $(\omega_c(t))$ is the time-varying angular frequency (carrier frequency) of the ith component.
-   $(\phi_i(t))$ is the time-varying phase of the ith component.

Each component of the signal is represented as a cosine function with its own time-varying amplitude, angular frequency, and phase. The amplitude modulation (AM) is captured by the time-varying amplitude $(A_i(t))$, which determines the envelope of the signal. The frequency modulation (FM) is accounted for by the time-varying angular frequency $(\omega_c(t))$, which controls the instantaneous frequency variations. The phase $(\phi_i(t))$ represents the initial phase of each component.
