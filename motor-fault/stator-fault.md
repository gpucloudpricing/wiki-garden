## Stator Faults

### Classification

- open-phase (open circuit) fault
- turn to turn short circuit (shorted turn, [Inter-turn Short Circuit Fault](inter-turn-short-circuit-fault.md)), (ITSF) within a coil
- coil to coil short circuit (shorted coil) within same phase
- phase to phase short circuit fault (including three-phase fault)
- coil to ground fault
- supply imbalance (unbalanced voltage)
- voltage surge
- overload
- iron core related

### Causes

- Mechanical stresses (due to movement of stator coil and rotor striking the stator)
- Electrical stresses (supply voltage transient due to different faults (like line-to-line, line-to-ground, or three-phase fault), due to lightning, opening, or closing of circuit breakers or due to variable frequency drives)
- Thermal stresses (due to thermal overloading, due to over current flowing due to sustained overload or fault, higher ambient temperature, obstructed ventilation, unbalanced supply voltage, etc.)
- Environmental stresses (too hot or too cold or too humid environment, presence of foreign material)

### Effects

#### Effects of winding failures

- High temperature (core, winding)
- Electrical discharges
- Environmental pollution
- Short circuit

#### Causes of winding failures

- breakdown of the windingâ€™s insulation
- high temperature,
- too many starts,
- contamination,
- too much current,
- excessive voltage
- physical damage.

Inter-turn short circuit of the stator winding in three-phase induction motors. (a) Short circuits in one phase due to motor overload (b) Short circuits in one phase due to blocked rotor. (c) Inter-turn short circuits are due to voltage transients. (d) Short circuits in one phase due to a phase loss in a Y-connected motor. (e) Short circuits in one phase due to a phase loss in a delta-connected motor. (f) Short circuits in one phase due to an unbalanced stator voltage
