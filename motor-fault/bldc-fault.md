Failure

- overheating and mechanical wear (Da et al, 2011) and
- demagnetization (Moosavi et al., 2015).

Categorization (Rajagopalan et al., 2006).

- stator faults,
- rotors faults,
  - eccentricities, unbalanced rotors, damaged rotor magnets, misalignments, and asymmetries
- inverter faults and
- bearing faults

Electrical faults  
short-circuited faults of the stator windings and resistive unbalance faults  
This kind of fault may produce an unbalance of stator voltages and currents, an increased torque pulsation, a decreased average torque or increased losses and excessive heating.

Mechanical faults.  
mechanical faults include eccentricity and bearing faults.  
They are due to a degradation process in the bearings, destruction of the bearing cage, balls and rollers, and rotor shaft deformation, among others.  
This kind of fault may result in increased friction for the brushless dc motor.
