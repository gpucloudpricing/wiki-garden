# Electric Motor Fault by Source

## Source of Electric Motor Fault

- Age. It’s easy to blame motor failure on age, but the reality is that the unstoppable creep of time is responsible for fewer than 20% of motor failures. In fact, **[Cooper Bussmann](https://www.progress-energy.com/assets/www/docs/business/motor-protection-voltage-unbalance.pdf)** says old age causes only 10% of electric motor failures.
- Bearing 51%.
- Winding 16%. We've put together a post on [**winding failure**](https://www.dukeelectric.com/blog/3-phase-winding-failure-examples/), with awesome photos courtesy of EASA, if you're looking for examples.
- External causes 16%. Tied with windings for almost 1 in 5 motor failures, external factors include temperature, contamination, poor maintenance, inappropriate mechanical loads and events such as flooding.
- Unknown. 1 in 10 failures are mysterious. Either no one bothered to determine why the failure occurred, so Bonnett and Yung didn’t have any data to work with, or the investigation failed to determine a cause.
- Rotor 5%.
- Shaft or coupling 2%. Shaft failure is the least common cause of motor failure. Physical damage, corrosion, improper installation and excessive loads are often the root cause.

### Problem

- Transient voltage (“surges” or “spikes”)
  - Possible causes: Power factor correction capacitor banks; Adjacent loads turning on and off; Electrical storms; Power quality issues
  - Effect on motor: Degrades windings; Arcing; “Micro-jogging” from motor timing interruptions
  - Signs to look for: There may be no physical damage to motor; Excess heat ; Vibration; Noise
- Voltage imbalance
  - Possible causes: Power quality issues; Faulty circuits; High resistance connections
  - Effect on motor: Stress on each phase circuit; Insulation breakdown; Core losses
  - Signs to look for: Excessive heat; Vibration; Noise; Increased operating costs
 - Current imbalance
   - Problems with leads, fuses, connections; Caused by either power supply or motor itself
   - Core losses; Torque pulsations
   - Excess heat; Vibration
  - Vibration
    - Missing balance weights; Uneven mass in motor windings; Unbalanced magnetic field; Uneven mounting (“soft foot”); Shaft looseness; Shaft imbalance; Misalignment; Insufficient load
    - Bearing problems; Insulation breakdown; Broken shaft; Broken feet; Rotor damage
    - Vibration
  - High operating temperature
    - Inadequate motor cooling; Wrong voltage supply; Buildup of dirt or debris in motor fins; Poor power quality; Voltage imbalance; Improper connections; Wrong motor for application
    - Reduces effectiveness of lubricants; Degrades windings
    - Motor is hot to touch; Hot spots in motor windings
  - Harmonic distortion
    - Faulty power circuit; Power quality issues
    - Reduces motor efficiency; Insulation deterioration
    - Overheating; Vibration; Noise; Reduced torque; Bearing currents
  - Motor overload
    - Excessive current draw; Insufficient torque
    - Damaged windings; Broken shaft; Damaged bearings
    - Overheating; Reduced torque
- Misalignment
  - Ineffective flexible coupling; Misalignment between motor drive shaft and load; Pipe strain; Uneven air gap; Bent or bowed shaft; Out-of-round rotor
  - Bearing problems; Excessive motor wear; Damage to shaft
  - Vibration of shaft; Vibration of load; High housing temperature close to bearings; High oil discharge temperature; Unusual oil leakage at bearing seals
- Moisture
  - Storing motor in a location without adequate climate control; Not using a totally enclosed fan cooled motor in a damp environment; Not positioning weep holes so water can drain from motor; Not keeping the temperature of the motor warmer than ambient air temperature
  - Corrosion of motor shaft, bearings and rotor; Insulation failure
  - Rust; Overheating
- Bearing current/shaft current
  - Leakage current from the armature windings (DC motors); Non-symmetrical magnetic fields; Induced voltage from a VFD
  - Bearing destruction
  - Noise; Overheating; Frosting of polished metal surfaces; Premature grease darkening
