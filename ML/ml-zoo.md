Tasks: regression, classification

- Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)

#### Regularization Algorithms

An extension made to another method (typically regression methods) that penalizes models based on their complexity, favoring simpler models that are also better at generalizing.

Tasks: regression

 - Ridge Regression
 - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
 - Elastic Net
 - Least-Angle Regression (LARS)

#### Decision Tree Algorithms

Decision tree methods construct a model of decisions made based on actual values of attributes in the data. Decisions fork in tree structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record.

Tasks: regression, classification

- Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
- Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
- Bayesian Network (BN)

#### Clustering Algorithms

Concerning with using the inherent structures in the data to best organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

Tasks: clustering

 - k-Means
 - k-Medians
 - Expectation Maximisation (EM)
 - Hierarchical Clustering

#### Instance Based Algorithms

Decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model by building up a database of example data and compare new data to the database using a similarity measure in order to find the best match and make a prediction.

Tasks: clustering, classification

- k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
- Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
- Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

#### Ensemble Algorithms

Models composed of multiple weaker models that are independently trained and whose predictions are combined in some way to make the overall prediction.

Tasks: classification, regression

- Boosting. To fit a sequence that is made out of weak learners to the weighted versions of the data, more weight is given to the examples that were misclassified in the earlier rounds.
- Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging). Reduce the variance of an estimate is by the average, to average together the multiple estimates.
