# Unsupervised Machine Learning

- No labeling task

## Tasks

- dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of input features in a dataset
- anomaly detection, detecting instances that are very different from the norm, also used for data cleaning
- clustering, grouping similar instances into clusters
- density estimation, estimating the density of the distribution (PDF) of data points
- association rule learning, to detect unobvious relationships between variables in a dataset

## Algorithm
