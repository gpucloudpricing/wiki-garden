(_[meyMachineLearningBasedUnbalance2020](zotero://select/library/items/XXSX3G7F)_, [link](), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212000), [zolib](https://www.zotero.org/irosyadi/items/XXSX3G7F))  
Hence, early detection of unbalances helps to minimize maintenance expenses, to avoid unnecessary production stops and to increase the service life of machines. Algorithmic detection of unbalances is accompanied with the least additional effort. The automation achieved in this way also enables live analysis of streamed data, which means that unbalances can be detected and corrected with almost no time delay, even before potential damage to the drive train occurs.
