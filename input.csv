That also means the torque is zero, so a unloaded motor can't spin that fast since there is always some friction. What happens is that the motor spins at a little lower speed.

Motor windings are therefore commonly driven with PWM just above the audible range, like 25-30 kHz."

This is different from a general model or simulation which will build a model from CAD and then have a series of expected flight simulations and use that to predict life of the engine.","For GE's digital twins in the jet engines, they will build a high fidelity representation of the each individual engine based on as built parts, and then they will simulate every flight based on accelerometers, force sensors, humidity sensors, temperature and pressure sensors which they have placed in the engine.

3D-virtual-model.md,1684815489824,"I work with digital twins in chemical manufacturing, and there the term is directly coupled with Model Predictive Control. The basic idea is that you build a model of the system (e.g. a chemical plant) you want to control, use that model to optimize controller behavior, apply the results to real controllers in the real system, and then sample the system to reground the model. Rinse, repeat. Such a model is called the ""digital twin"" of the real system - the idea is that it exists next to the system and is continuously updated to match the real world.","I work with digital twins in chemical manufacturing, and there the term is directly coupled with Model Predictive Control.

Although some exceptions exist, see [14,15,16,17], these updating methods are typically limited to linear(ized) systems [8, 18]. Furthermore, these methods are based on expensive iterative sensitivity methods [16, 17, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25] or physically non-interpretable direct methods [21, 26,27,28]. Consequently, these techniques do not meet the four requirements for model updating for DTs as mentioned above and are thus not regarded as a viable solution to the problem considered here.","- The first type concerns updating methods originating from the field of structural dynamics, see, e.g., [9, 13] for an overview.

For an overview of system identification techniques see, for example, [29,30,31]. Note that, in contrast to model updating in the field of, typically linear(ized), structural dynamics, system identification has been developed for nonlinear systems [32, 33]. However, due to the fact that in system identification generic model classes are fitted to data, the identified models are difficult to interpret from a physical perspective [34] and thus, do not satisfy the above requirements.","- Alternatively, system identification techniques are used to find a model that describes measured data.

dt-model-updating.md,1690692884010,"- A third type of parameter updating techniques concerns filter-based (or observer-based) methods. Examples are the vanilla [35], extended [36, 37], and unscented Kalman filter [38,39,40], Gaussian filters [41, 42], and particle filters [43]. Although these approaches are often used for DTs, for complex systems (i.e., systems with many states and/or parameters), filter methods might suffer from relatively high computational costs, prohibiting online updating (especially if the required sampling frequency is relatively high) [43]. Furthermore, filter-based methods require an initial guess for the parameter estimates. If this information is not available or sudden changes to the parameter values occur, filter methods might end up in local minima. To avoid this, initial parameter values may be estimated using a coarse global parameter estimation method [38] at a significant cost of computation time. Finally, filter-based updating methods typically require direct accessibility to closed-form EoMs of the dynamical model for the user. Consequently, filter-based methods cannot be directly applied to simulation models (as obtained from, e.g., FE/multibody software packages, or Matlab-based packages as Simulink or Simscape) that may be used to constitute a digital twin.","- A third type of parameter updating techniques concerns filter-based (or observer-based) methods.

[45,46,47] on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that is also adopted by other researchers [48]. In this method, coefficients of (partial) differential equations governing the measured system are learned using a neural network. In general, the learned coefficients of these (partial) differential equations, however, do not refer to directly interpretable physical quantities, e.g., masses, damping, and stiffness constants. Additionally, to update a set of coefficients using measured data, a neural network needs to be trained, which can take significant computation time and hence, impede real-time updating.

dt-model-updating.md,1690692884010,"- As an alternative, the inverse problem of estimating physically interpretable parameter values in a continuous domain using measurement data can be solved using an inverse mapping model (IMM). Here, the IMM directly maps, with small computational costs, a set of measured features, describing the (dynamical) behavior of a system, to a set of corresponding physically-interpretable parameter values of the reference model. In the literature, (trained) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been found suitable to constitute these IMMs due to their generic function approximation characteristics [18, 60,61,62,63]. Consequently, this methodology was coined the neural network updating method (NNUM) by Atalla [18]. Note that, since other generic function approximation algorithms may also be used to constitute IMMs, the authors prefer to refer to this methodology as the inverse mapping parameter updating (IMPU) method. For example, in recent work of the authors, Gaussian processes are used as IMMs, with the added benefit of enabling uncertainty quantification for the estimated parameter values [64]. The main qualitative advantage of this method with respect to previously discussed parameter updating methods is that online parameter updating is enabled even for large-scale systems with high sampling frequencies. This is enabled by shifting a significant majority of the computation time to an offline (training) phase, whereas the required online (inference) computations are extremely efficient and scale marginally with the complexity of the system. Although this IMPU methodology thus satisfies requirements 1 (real-time updating) and 2 (physically interpretable updating) for a broad range of systems and their DTs, this IMPU methodology has, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, however, only been applied to linear(ized) dynamical systems. Also note that the IMPU method can be applied on parametric models derived using any of the aforementioned model derivation options (first-principles, FE/multibody software, or multi-disciplinary software packages), yielding valuable flexibility in the modeling of the DT.","- As an alternative, the inverse problem of estimating physically interpretable parameter values in a continuous domain using measurement data can be solved using an inverse mapping model (IMM).

critical-difference-diagram.md,1678221887881,"When multiple classifiers are compared, the results of the post-hoc tests can be visually represented with a simple diagram. The top line in the diagram is the axis on which we plot the average ranks of methods. The axis is turned so that the lowest (best) ranks are to the right since we perceive the methods on the right side as better. When comparing all the algorithms against each other, we connect the groups of algorithms that are not significantly different (Figure 1(a)). We also show the critical difference above the graph. If the methods are compared to the control using the Bonferroni-Dunn test we can mark the interval of one CD to the left and right of the average rank of the control algorithm (Figure 1(b)). Any algorithm with the rank outside this area is significantly different from the control. Similar graphs for the other post-hoc tests would need to plot a different adjusted critical interval for each classifier and specify the procedure used for testing and the corresponding order of comparisons, which could easily become confusing.","When multiple classifiers are compared, the results of the post-hoc tests can be visually represented with a simple diagram.

The machine current and voltage signal analysis methods are sensitive to electrical failures and vibration analysis is sensitive to mechanical failures. Partial demagnetization causes asymmetric and unbalanced radial forces, which result in huge vibration and audible noise. To analyze the pattern of this vibration, a piezoelectric vibration sensor needs to be installed on the motor stator. In case of severe noise, acoustic noise-based analysis can be utilized as an additional approach.","- explanation: Vibration analysis in PM motor health monitoring is a non-intrusive technique which is widely used for fault detection and similar to signal analysis, several commercial applications and industries utilize it.

Non-stationary.md,1690448471976,"The variable-speed PMSM drive system may cause variation of the fault characteristic frequency, and the fault should then be diagnosed in the non-stationary state. For feature extraction from non-stationary signals, time–frequency analysis methods, such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform, are very popular. In [18], fault detection in power transformers was studied; both STFT and wavelet transform were used to process the neutral and/or capacitively transformed currents recorded during an impulse test. In [19–22], wavelet transform was applied to analyze the signals in the electrical motor under a non-stationary condition. When applying STFT, a suitable window size is needed to match with the specific frequency content of the signal, which is generally not known in advance [20]. This leads to an inconsistent treatment of different current frequencies because of the fixed length of the window. Hence, it is not suitable for fault detection when the motor is not operating at constant speed. Wavelet transform solves the non-stationary problem by decomposing a time series into time/frequency space simultaneously. It can provide a good resolution in time for high-frequency components of a signal and a good resolution in frequency for low frequency components. In this sense, wavelets have a window that is automatically adjusted to give the appropriate resolution developed by its approximation and detail signals, thus making it a very suitable approach to detect the faults of electrical machine in a non-stationary state. Non-stationary State In this section, the reference rotor speed of the PMSM is variable and shown in Figure 7, where the speed is linear decreased from 1000r/min at 0.5 sec to 700 r/min at 2.5 sec.","The variable-speed PMSM drive system may cause variation of the fault characteristic frequency, and the fault should then be diagnosed in the non-stationary state.

These notable differences in **maintenance costs** can be explained, when it comes to the electric vehicle, by the absence of wear parts that require changing regularly as well as no need for major engine repairs.There are far fewer parts and fewer things to go wrong."

These are usually a result of physical instability stemming from several possible scenarios. Misaligned parts may cause the motor to sway unusually, resulting in the motor shaking."
fault-in-BLDC-motor.md,1678219572852,"However, it is now clear that the main cause of failure in brushless RC motors is heat. As a matter of fact, it has been documented that over half of all insulating failures in motors are a result of excessive heat. For optimum performance, brushless engines must have an operational temperature of about 150-160oF. Any more than that, and your motor runs the risk of severe performance issues and eventual failure. Once temperatures get too high, the rotor magnets and the stator electromagnets within the motor are depleted of their ability to get the rotor moving optimally. Like vibrations, heat can be gained in a variety of ways. In most day-to-day scenarios, an increase in temperature will stem from high current and electrical load. As increasing levels of a current surge through the motor’s wiring, heat slowly builds up in the motor windings.","However, it is now clear that the main cause of failure in brushless RC motors is heat. As a matter of fact, it has been documented that over half of all insulating failures in motors are a result of excessive heat. For optimum performance, brushless engines must have an operational temperature of about 150-160oF. Any more than that, and your motor runs the risk of severe performance issues and eventual failure. Once temperatures get too high, the rotor magnets and the stator electromagnets within the motor are depleted of their ability to get the rotor moving optimally.

flux-monitoring-motor-phm.md,1678095913090,"Throughout the literature, the most frequently used flux sensors to measure the stray flux in electrical machines are coreless coils, normally known as research coils. Some authors use rectangular-shaped coils. Only a few authors use other types of sensors such as giant magneto resistive (GMR) or tunneling magneto resistive sensors (TMR). The general operation principle dictates that the sensors supply an induced voltage, which is proportional to the derivative of the flux. The induced voltage is then recorded and analyzed with appropriate signal processing methods. The positioning of the sensor on the machine is also important as it can lead to the measurement of either the axial or the radial component of the stray flux.

unbalance-motor-problem.md,1684590289375,"Mass unbalance is one of the common problems associated with motor vibration. Unbalanced masses in the rotating parts create a centrifugal force that causes the unit to vibrate. Mass unbalance occurs when the geometric centre (shaft centreline) and the mass centre of a rotor do not coincide.

Therefore, in a first approach, mass-eccentricity will be emulated by applying a dynamic eccentricity onto the machine."

bhattiFutureSmartElectric2021.md,1678223580968,"Worldwide, transportation accounts for 18% of global carbon dioxide emissions (as of 2019). In order to battle the impending threat of climate change, consumers and industry must adopt sustainable transport that complies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. To fulfil these objectives, a new class of vehicles has recently emerged, smart electric vehicles, which is forecasted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions up to 43% as compared to diesel engine vehicles. However, to bring these vehicles to the mainstream, supporting architecture is needed to optimize them in a sustainable manner. One such novel architecture is Digital Twin Technology, which is a virtual mapping technology, extending from it, capable of investigating the lifecycle of multisystem bodies in a digital environment. In recent years, digital twin technology is becoming an underpinning area of research globally. As a result, novel individual research covering digital twin implementation on various aspects of smart vehicles has transpired in research and industrial studies, consequently allowing digital twin technology to evolve over the years. This work aims to bridge the gap between individual research to provide a comprehensive review from a technically-informed and academically neutral standpoint. Conceptual groundwork of digital twin technology is built systematically for the reader, to allow insight into its inception and evolution. The study sifts the digital twin domain for contributions in smart vehicle systems, exploring its potential and contemporaneous challenges to realization. The study then proceeds to review recent research and commercial projects for innovation within this domain. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first extensive review of the application of digital twin technology in smart electric vehicles. The review has been systematically classified into specific domains within the smart vehicle system such as autonomous navigation control, advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle health monitoring, battery management systems, vehicle power electronics, and electrical power drive systems. An in-depth discussion of each vehicle subsystem is undertaken to present this review as an eclectic panorama of the smart vehicle system. This review further facilitates appreciation of the role of digital twin technology within each classification from a holistic technical perspective. Finally, the work ends with an inspection of the techno-socio-economic impact of digital twin technology that will revolutionize mainstream vehicle technology and the obstacles for further development.","Worldwide, transportation accounts for 18% of global carbon dioxide emissions (as of 2019).

In that case you'll get 256 gray levels covering range of 15 degrees, so black color is 22°С, white is 37°С (keep in mind proportion is not linear!). You move your camera to a cup of hot tea with like 60°С and your relation of gray level to temperature changes.

2023-08-01.md,1690871619534,"The specific reconstruction steps of the digital twin model are as follows. When the working condition changes, the current working condition changes from the original working condition to the target working condition. A small amount of machining data under the target working condition is collected and preprocessed to obtain the machining data set of the target working condition. Based on the machining data set of the target working condition, the experimental parameters of the mechanism model are finetuned to complete the self-renewal. Then, the primary features of the original data are extracted to obtain the feature data of the target working condition and get stored into the feature database. After this, the distribution distance of feature data between the current working condition and other working condition is calculated to obtain the feature data set with the smallest distribution distance. The data set is indexed in the algorithm model base and machining database to obtain the original model in the algorithm library and the machining data set of related working conditions.","The specific reconstruction steps of the digital twin model are as follows.
