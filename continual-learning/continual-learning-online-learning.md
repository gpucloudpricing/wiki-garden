## Continual Learning vs Online Learning

### Offline Learning vs Online Learning vs Incremental (Continual) Learning

- [**Online learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning) are machine learning techniques that update the models as new data is collected or arrives sequentially, as opposed to **batch learning** (or _offline learning_), where you first collect a dataset of multiple instances and then you train a model once (although you can later update it when you update your dataset).
- Offline learning (batch learning) is currently the common way of training machine learning models, given that it avoids problems like the known [**catastrophic interference**](https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/13293/2444) (aka _catastrophic forgetting_) problem, which can occur if you learn online. For example, neural networks are known to face this problem when learning online.
- There are **incremental learning** (aka _lifelong learning_) algorithms that attempt to address this _catastrophic interference_ problem.

### Continual Learning vs Online Learning

1. Definition
- **Continual learning** is the problem of learning and retaining knowledge through time over multiple tasks and environments. **Continual learning**, also called lifelong learning or online machine learning, is a fundamental idea in machine learning in which models continuously learn and evolve based on the input of increasing amounts of data while retaining previously learned knowledge.
- **Online learning** is the problem of learning from data that arrives in a sequential order. Online learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from new data in real-time as it arrives. The model is updated continuously as new data comes in. This type of learning is useful when the data is too large to fit into memory or when the data is constantly changing.
- Batch learning

1. Learning Paradigm:
   - Continual Learning: It refers to the ability of a model to learn and adapt continuously over time, without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The model incrementally learns from new data while preserving its past knowledge.
   - Online Learning: It refers to a learning paradigm where the model learns from a continuous stream of data in real-time. Each data instance is processed once and then discarded, as the model updates its parameters accordingly.

2. Data Availability:
   - Continual Learning: The data used for training in continual learning is often limited and divided into multiple tasks or concepts. The model learns incrementally on each task, and the availability of data for each task may not be uniform.
   - Online Learning: In online learning, data arrives sequentially and is generally assumed to be abundant. The model learns from individual data instances or small batches of data in real-time.

3. Memory of Past Data:
   - Continual Learning: Continual learning focuses on retaining knowledge from past tasks while learning new ones. It aims to prevent catastrophic forgetting by updating the model in a way that preserves the previously learned information.
   - Online Learning: Online learning typically discards past data after it has been used for training. The model does not explicitly store or recall previous data instances, as it continuously adapts to new incoming data.

4. Training Process:
   - Continual Learning: Continual learning often involves a two-step process: first, the model is trained on a new task using available data, and then it undergoes consolidation or regularization techniques to retain previously learned knowledge.
   - Online Learning: Online learning is characterized by immediate updates to the model as new data arrives. The model's parameters are updated incrementally after processing each data instance or batch.

5. Application Scenarios:
   - Continual Learning: Continual learning is well-suited for scenarios where the model needs to learn multiple tasks sequentially over time, such as in lifelong learning or adaptive systems. Example: self-driving cars, robotics, medical diagnosis
   - Online Learning: Online learning is suitable for scenarios where the model needs to adapt to a continuous stream of data, such as real-time prediction, recommendation systems, or online advertising. Examples: fraud detection, spam filtering, stock market prediction

6. Key characteristics:
- Continual learning
  - **Sequential Tasks:** Continual learning involves learning from a sequence of tasks or data distributions over time.
  - **Knowledge Retention:** The system needs to retain knowledge from previous tasks, even as it learns new tasks.
  - **Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation:** Techniques such as regularization, replay, and parameter isolation are used to mitigate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
  - **Model Expansion:** The model’s capacity may need to be increased over time to accommodate new tasks.
  - **Few-Shot or Zero-Shot Learning:** In some cases, the model should be able to learn new tasks with very few or even zero examples.
- Online learning
  - **Continuous Data Streams:** Online learning is suited for scenarios where data arrives in a continuous stream or in small batches over time.
  - **Efficiency:** It allows the model to adapt to changing data patterns and concepts without requiring full retraining.
  - **Resource Efficiency:** Online learning can save computational resources compared to retraining on the entire dataset.
  - **Adaptation:** The model can quickly adapt to concept drift or changes in the data distribution.
  - **Real-time Decision Making:** Online learning is useful when making real-time predictions or decisions based on new data.
