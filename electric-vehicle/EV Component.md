The function of the battery in an electric car is as an electrical [energy storage system](https://www.omazaki.co.id/en/energy-storage-systems/) in the form of direct-current electricity (DC).

###### **Power Inverter (B)**

The inverter functions to change the direct current (DC) on the battery into an alternating current (AC) and then this alternating current is used by an electric motor.

###### **Controller (C)**

The main function of the controller is as a regulator of electrical energy from batteries and inverters that will be distributed to electric motors.
