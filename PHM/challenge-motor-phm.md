# Challenge of PHM in Motor

Challenge on PHM (Falekas and Karlis 2021)

- accurate CM ⭢ depend on models: productive algorithm need good model
- in PHM with AI techniques ⭢ depend on data quality produced: as methodologies largely depend on accurate values to produce acceptable results.

Limitation on PHM on Electric Machinery

- false indications,
- low sensitivity,
- difficulty of fault interpretation
- difficulties that arise from variable frequency drive (VFD) operation with the increase in the number of inverter-fed motors.
