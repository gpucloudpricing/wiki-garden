[The 50 Failure Modes of Electric Motors – UE Systems](https://www.uesystems.com/the-50-failure-modes-of-electric-motors/)

There are between 8 and 10 components within a motor, each with its own failure modes, bringing the total to around 50, so by properly addressing them, you can greatly extend the life of your motor.

- Motor housing. Failures in motor housing can crop up from improper installation, physical damage, corrosion and material buildup. While motor housing may not seem like a true performance component, these shortcomings can ultimately affect the way others perform. For instance, a soft foot could lead to bearing failures, shaft bending and broken or cracked feet. This emerges if a motor, when placed in a flat surface, does not have all its feet flat on the surface. Material buildup can heat up the operating temperature of the motor, ultimately leading to damage on other parts of the motor, such as bearings.
- Motor stator. Motor stator failure modes emerge from physical damage, contamination, corrosion, high temperature, voltage imbalance, broken supports and rewind burnout procedures. A lot of times, these can emerge from motor repair shops. Stator failures occur due to the rewind burnout of the windings. This often happens before the motor can be rewound requiring emergency repairs. But because the plant will need the motor returned as soon as possible, hasty repairs can end up damaging the stators by improperly heating the housing and the stator. This can also lead to motor inefficiencies.
- Motor rotors. Rotors are composed of numerous layers of laminated steel and the rotor windings are composed of bars of copper or aluminum alloy that is shorted on both sides with shorting rings. These components can then fail through thermal stress, physical damage, imbalance, broken rotor bar, contamination and improper installation. Physical damage on rotors can develop after certain emergency maintenance tasks including bearing replacement, motor rebuilds and during a disassembly and reassembly process. Generally speaking, motor bearings should not be changed at plant locations and especially on critical equipment. Imbalanced motor rotors are common, but this can put a lot of strain on bearings. This will ultimately lead to a rotor making contact with a stator and creating another point of failure. Again, improper rebuilding tactics, such as overheating, can damage rotor components as well. By establishing precision balance standards, you can be sure you are preventing these kinds of imbalance failures.
- Motor bearings. Motor bearings within an electric motor can emerge from improper handling and storage, improper installation, misalignment, improper lubrication, start/stop processes, contamination, overhung loads and motor fan imbalance. Contamination is one of the biggest reasons for bearing failure modes. This occurs when foreign contaminants or moisture enter the bearings, usually during the lubrication process. You can take steps to prevent contamination during the regreasing process to ensure that they are kept out. It is also important that your motor is properly outfitted for the task for which it was selected. This means using the right bearings for its application. Motors that are using sheaves or sprockets that are mounted on the shaft will need roller bearings in the motor, which are common among most standard motors. Lubrication can always be a major cause of failure because there are so many different places where one can improperly apply lubrication. Too much or too little lubrication, along with the improper form of lubrication, can lead to premature wear and tear. All motor greases should be polyurea-based, and not all purpose greases. One should always take the plug out of the bottom so that old grease can be drained properly. Also, release valves can help prevent over greasing. Motor bearing seal failures tend to emerge from improper lubrication or installation.
- Motor fans. Motor fans tend to fail from physical damage, ice buildup, foreign materials and corrosion. Fans help keep the temperature down on a motor, which is essential to making sure that the rest of the components are performing well. The motor fan guard failures can also lead to a larger motor failure. This tends to happen through physical damage and plugging. By taking the time to keep them clean, you can go a long way in preventing fan guard failures.
- Motor insulation and windings. When it comes to motor insulation and windings, there are a number of potential issues. Contamination and moisture can lead to winding failures. Often times, this is because they are not stored in ambient areas. Overheating is another issue that can cause a motor failure. Insulation breakdown, cycling and flexing, along with AC drive stress, round out the possible failure modes for this category. The life of the insulation in a standard electric motor is based on the temperature at which the motor operates. This means for an electric motor that is operating at a particularly high temperature, you could be cutting back on its lifespan. In fact, for every 18 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, the insulation life is cut in half. While better insulation can extend the lifespan, temperature is easily one of the biggest factors in this instance. This means bringing in cooler outside air. Insulation breakdown can be a big problem, as it will cause windings to short out. These problems can be detected through MCE testing and thermography. Winding shorts from turn to turn can crop up from contaminants abrasion, vibration or voltage surges. Cycling and flexing is another problem that typically occurs from frequent start and stop operations from the motor. This kind of an operation cycle can lead to the frequent heating and cooling of windings and insulation, which can lead to wear and tear, such as holes, ultimately leading the motor to short and fail.
- Motor shaft. Motor shaft failure modes occur due to physical damage, improper manufacturing, improper installation and corrosion. For instance, installing a motor improperly can cause certain components, such as the motor casing, to corrode and create imbalance.

[The essential guide to electric motor failure | Duke Electric](https://www.dukeelectric.com/electric-motor-failure/)
- Age. It’s easy to blame motor failure on age, but the reality is that the unstoppable creep of time is responsible for fewer than 20% of motor failures. In fact, **[Cooper Bussmann](https://www.progress-energy.com/assets/www/docs/business/motor-protection-voltage-unbalance.pdf)** says old age causes only 10% of electric motor failures.
- Bearing 51%. Bearings are the culprit in more than half of motor failure cases. Improper lubrication, inappropriate mechanical loads, heat, contamination and shaft currents are all the usual suspects when it comes to bearing problems. Get the [**bearing failure checklist**](https://www.dukeelectric.com/blog/bearing-failure-checklist/).
- Winding 16%. A winding failure—which is often caused by a breakdown of the winding’s insulation—will cause a short in the motor. Common causes of winding failure include high temperature, too many starts, contamination, too much current, excessive voltage and physical damage. We've put together a post on [**winding failure**](https://www.dukeelectric.com/blog/3-phase-winding-failure-examples/), with awesome photos courtesy of EASA, if you're looking for examples.
- External causes 16%. Tied with windings for almost 1 in 5 motor failures, external factors include temperature, contamination, poor maintenance, inappropriate mechanical loads and events such as flooding.
- Unknown. 1 in 10 failures are mysterious. Either no one bothered to determine why the failure occurred, so Bonnett and Yung didn’t have any data to work with, or the investigation failed to determine a cause.
- Rotor 5%. Starts (too many, not enough of a break between them or extended start times), sudden action or outburst,  are the culprit in some rotor failures. Other failures are caused by vibration, physical damage and situations that causes excessive heat.
- Shaft or coupling 2%. Shaft failure is the least common cause of motor failure. Physical damage, corrosion, improper installation and excessive loads are often the root cause.
