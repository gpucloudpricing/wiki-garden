## PHM Methods

### PHM Approach

- Physics-based models
- Knowledge-based
- Data-driven models

PHM approach methods ([sajidDataScienceApplications2021](zotero://select/library/items/MY5HCJS7) [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221478532100448X))

- Knowledge Based approach
	- Based on experience, it is classified into three types: a rules-based approach, a case-based approach and a fuzzy knowledge-based approach.
	- Knowledge-based rules are in the format of ‘If-then’ and knowledge obtained from previous experience or concrete problem situations.
	- Drawbacks are difficulty in obtaining accurate knowledge from experience and limited access to experts with knowledge. Therefore, it results in low prediction accuracy.
	- Currently used in data mining techniques for extracting required knowledge from databases
	- Examples: expert system, fuzzy system
- Data-Driven approach
	- Use computational power and a large amount of data
	- Data processing and analyses of big industrial data, the degradation of components, the remaining useful life and maintenance can be mined.
	- Sub methods: statistical models, stochastic models, and machine learning models
	- Example: machine learning, deep learning
- Physical Model approach
	- Based on laws of physics and mathematics for assessing degradation of components
	- Without a lot of data collection, this model can reveal the faulty logic of the system
	- Since most equipment is complex mechanical and electrical systems, establishing degradation models is difficult because of the ignorance of degradation.
	- Example: Kalman filter, Particle filter, FEM
- Digital Twin approach
	- Digital twin (DT) integrates multidisciplinary, multi-probability and multi-scale using physical model, sensor and real-time data
	- DT combines data and models, which creates a bridge between the physical world and the digital world
