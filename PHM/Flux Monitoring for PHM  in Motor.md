"Nonetheless, after many years now, the consensus is that there is no method based on a single quantity that can provide a comprehensive knowledge of the machine's health conditions. Most commercialised techniques are based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA), which has been proved to be susceptible to false/missed alarms."

Throughout the literature, the most frequently used flux sensors to measure the stray flux in electrical machines are coreless coils, normally known as research coils. Some authors use rectangular-shaped coils. Only a few authors use other types of sensors such as giant magneto resistive (GMR)  or tunneling magneto resistive sensors (TMR). The general operation principle dictates that the sensors supply an induced voltage, which is proportional to the derivative of the flux. The induced voltage is then recorded and analyzed with appropriate signal processing methods. The positioning of the sensor on the machine is also important as it can lead to the measurement of either the axial or the radial component of the stray flux. Other industrial sensors, not often used for electrical machine monitoring, are the flux gate sensors or the hall effect sensor. However, many researchers design their own sensors adapted to the size of the machine.

Hall Effect as Flux Sensor
This work introduces a smart-sensor based on primary hall effect sensors, which is able to capture the stray flux in different directions in its axial, radial, and combination of both components (by installing it in just one position on the frame).
The stray flux can be analyzed through its two magnetic components: axial and radial stray flux. It is known that the axial field is generated by currents in the stator end windings or rotor cage end ring and is located in a plane that comprises the machine axis, while the radial field is located in a plane perpendicular to the machine axis.

One of this advantages is that the GMR sensor has a large detection range of magnetic strength with different levels of output voltage. Additionally, the sensitivity of the device is improved due to the embedded magnetic flux concentrators.
The Hall device is an alternative choice for magnetic flux signal detection. Once an electron is influenced by a magnetic field, it will be affected by the Lorentz force which leads to a perpendicular move in the direction of both the magnetic field and of the movement of the electron. In this case, if there is a current flowing through a magnetic field, a difference in the electrons will appear between two sides, which is the output of the Hall devices. In practice, the output of a Hall device is quite small, and therefore a built-in amplifier is need to magnify the signal and reduce noise. In these circumstances, the outputs of most Hall devices are absolute values.

The stray ﬂux sensor was composed of a C-shaped ferrite nucleus, on which 300 turns of 0.112 mm diameter wire were wound. The sensor was located on the ﬁnal part of the body of the motor, with its longitudinal axis parallel to the axis of the motor.
