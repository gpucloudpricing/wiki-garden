Challenge on PHM:
- accurate CM ⭢ depend on models: productive algorithm need good model
- in PHM with AI techniques ⭢ depend on data quality produced: as methodologies largely depend on accurate values to produce acceptable results. 

With Digital Twin:
- enhance modeling and DAQ fidelity
- increase data generation

Thus, the capability of a DT to generate a virtual copy of the system is  invaluable in PHM. (Falekas and Karlis 2021)
