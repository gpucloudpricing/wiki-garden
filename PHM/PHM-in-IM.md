# PHM in Induction Motor

Traditional IM fault diagnostic method (by human): smell, temperature increase, excessive vibration, and increased acoustic noise level.  
Problem: These physical symptoms are prone to being contaminated with noise from other sources.

Alternative: signal processing techniques.  
Traditional machinery fault detection is based on thermal signals, acoustic signals, and vibration signals.
