- [montana-knowledge-management/digital-twin-distiller](https://github.com/montana-knowledge-management/digital-twin-distiller) Python project for creating a long-lasting, encapsulated version of your numerical simulation or your machine-learning-based project.
  - How to use: The proposed algorithm was integrated into the digital-twin-distiller, the created model was saved as a digital twin, and its encapsulated version is deployed in the production environment.
  - How to use: The proposed methodologies integrated into the digital-twin-distiller, the created model were saved as a digital twin, and not only the source code of the model but its encapsulated version can be accessed from the digital-twin-distiller projects homepage (http://www.distiller.dev), accessed on 17 October 2021). This containerized version of the code contains the model and the simulation together, as a digital twin (DT). It can be run via the online application interface without any installation. The proposed solution supports long term usability and reproducibility for the proposed model
