Keywords: data-fusion, multi-sensor, fault-detection

## Data Fusion Model

Data fusion model:

- JDL model,
- Boydâ€™s OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) Loop model,
- Intelligence Cycle model,
- the Omnibus model,
- State Transition Data Fusion (STDF) model,
- Hierarchical model
- Dasarathy model,
- Waterfall model,
- Hybrid model.

## Data Fusion Algorithm

- simple processing algorithms
  - the weighted average method (weighting the average data acquired by the same type of sensors in continuous time series according to the chronological order, yielding the final fusion value).
- probability-based algorithms,
  - Bayesian theory
    - Bayesian networks
    - naive Bayes
    - non-naive Bayes
    - Bayesian inference
  - D-S evidence theory.
    - preprocessing the original evidence
    - improvement of combination rules
    - combination of other algorithms
- fuzzy logic-based algorithms,
  - fuzzy logic algorithm
    - fuzzy logic reasoning,
    - fuzzy clustering algorithm
    - intuitionistic fuzzy set
    - a combination of other algorithms
  - fuzzy set
  - rough set: attribute reduction and noise removal
- artificial intelligence algorithms
  - neural networks
    - Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN)
    - Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN)
    - Elman Neural Network (ENN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) for small number of samples
  - deep learning.
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Deep Belief Network (DBN)
    - Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- other algorithms.
  - ant colony algorithm
  - genetic algorithm
  - Kalman filtering

## Fusion strategies

- select a reasonable data preprocessing method
- select a reasonable neural network model, and use a heuristic algorithm to optimize the network model.
