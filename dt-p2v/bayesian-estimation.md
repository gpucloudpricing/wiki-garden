# Recursive Bayesian Estimation

- Recursive Bayesian estimation (Bayes filter) is a general probabilistic approach for estimating an unknown probability density function (PDF) recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process model.
- The process relies heavily upon mathematical concepts and models that are theorized within a study of prior and posterior probabilities known as Bayesian statistics.

## Sequential Bayesian filtering

- Sequential Bayesian filtering is the extension of the Bayesian estimation for the case when the observed value changes in time.
- It is a method to estimate the real value of an observed variable that evolves in time.  
- The method is named:  
  - filtering when estimating the current value given past and current observations,
  - smoothing when estimating past values given past and current observations, and
  - prediction when estimating a probable future value given past and current observations.
