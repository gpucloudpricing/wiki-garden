## P2V with Physical Measurements

- Using physical measurements to update the movements or position of digital models, mainly for [Geometric Modeling in Digital Twin](../DT-modeling/DT-modeling-geometric.md)
- Using physical system monitoring data as input for physics-based analysis or design, manly for [Physical Modeling in Digital Twin](../DT-modeling/DT-modeling-physic.md)

### Application of P2V with Physical Measurements

- when digital states (e.g., position, mobility, traffic flow) can be directly updated using monitoring data.
- However, for many engineering problems, digital states cannot be directly updated and are affected by various uncertainty sources.
