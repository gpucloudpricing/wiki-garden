1. Rated Torque: The rated torque of a BLDC motor is the maximum continuous torque that the motor is designed to produce without exceeding its temperature limits. It represents the maximum torque that the motor can continuously deliver under normal operating conditions. The rated torque is typically provided by the motor manufacturer and is specified in units such as Newton meters (Nm) or ounce-inches (oz-in).
    
2. Rated Current: The rated current of a BLDC motor is the maximum continuous current that the motor windings are designed to carry without exceeding their temperature limits. It represents the maximum current that can flow through the motor windings under normal operating conditions. The rated current is also specified by the motor manufacturer and is typically given in units of amperes (A).
3. Rated power in a brushless motor refers to the maximum continuous power output that the motor is designed to deliver without exceeding its temperature limits. It represents the power that the motor can continuously generate under normal operating conditions.

The rated power of a brushless motor is determined by its rated torque and rated speed. It can be calculated using the following formula:

Rated Power (P) = Rated Torque (T) * Rated Speed (Ï‰)
