## \"r alias raw string

An ‘r’ before a string tells the Python interpreter to treat backslashes as a literal (raw) character. Normally, Python uses backslashes as escape characters. Prefacing the string definition with ‘r’ is a useful way to define a string where you need the backslash to be an actual backslash and not part of an escape code that means something else in the string.

## \"f alias f string

Also called “formatted string literals,” f-strings are string literals that have an `f` at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and then formatted using the `__format__` protocol.
